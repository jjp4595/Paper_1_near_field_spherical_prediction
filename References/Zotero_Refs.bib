  title = {Predicting the Effectiveness of Blast Wall Barriers Using Neural Networks},
  volume = {34},
  abstract = {Blast damage assessment of buildings and structural elements requires an accurate prediction of the blast loads in terms of the peak pressures and impulses. Blast loadings on structures have typically been evaluated using empirical relationships. These relationships assume that there are no obstacles between the explosive device and the target. If a blast barrier is used to protect personnel or a structure behind it, the actual blast loading environment will be signiﬁcantly reduced for some distance behind the barrier. This paper is concerned with an accurate prediction of the area of effectiveness behind the barrier using experimental data and a neural network-based model. To train and validate the neural network, a database is developed through a series of measurements of the blast environment behind the barrier. The principal parameters controlling the blast environment, such as wall height, distance behind the wall, height above ground, and standoff distance are used as the training input data. Peak overpressure and peak scaled impulse are used as the outputs in the neural network conﬁguration. The trained and validated neural network is used to develop contour plots of overpressure and impulse adjustment factors to simplify the process of predicting the effectiveness of blast barriers. The developed model is also deployed in a stand-alone application that is used as a fast-running predictive tool for the blast overpressures and impulses behind the wall.},

  volume = {128},
  abstract = {Recent experimental work by the current authors has provided highly spatially and temporally resolved measurements of the loading imparted to, and the subsequent dynamic response of, structures subjected to near-ﬁeld explosive loading [1]. In this article we validate ﬁnite element models of plates subjected to near-ﬁeld blast loads and perform a parametric study into the relationship between imparted load and peak and residual plate deformation. The energy equivalent impulse is derived, based on the theory of upper bound kinetic energy uptake introduced herein, which accounts for the additional energy imparted to a structure from a spatially non-uniform blast load. Whilst plate deﬂection is weakly correlated to total impulse, there is shown to be a strong positive correlation between deﬂection and energy equivalent impulse. The strength of this correlation is insensitive to loading distribution and mode of response. The method developed in this article has clear applications for the generation of fast-running engineering tools for the prediction of structural response to near-ﬁeld explosions.},

  abstract = {When a blast wave strikes a finite target, diffraction of the blast wave around the free edge causes a rarefaction clearing wave to propagate along the loaded face and relieve the pressure acting at any point it passes over. For small targets, the time taken for this clearing wave to traverse the loaded face will be small in relation to the duration of loading. Previous studies have not shown what happens in the late-time stages of clearing relief, nor the mechanism by which the cleared reflected pressure decays to approach the incident pressure. Current design guidance assumes a series of interacting clearing waves propagate over the target face – this assumption is tested in this article by using numerical analysis to evaluate the blast pressure acting on small targets subjected to blast loads. It is shown that repeat propagations of the rarefaction waves do not occur and new model is proposed, based on an over-expanded region of air in front of the loaded face of the target.},

Literature guidance for determining the exact effects of angle of incidence are unclear, particularly when considering the negative phase. This paper presents the results from a series of well controlled experiments where pressure transducers are used to record the pressure-time history acting on the face of a large, rigid target at various angles of incidence for varying sizes of hemispherical PE4 charge and stand-off distances. The test data demonstrated remarkable repeatability, and excellent agreement with semi-empirical predictions for normally reflected overpressures. The oblique results show that peak overpressure, impulse and duration are highly dependent on angle of incidence for the positive phase, and are invariant of angle of incidence for the negative phase.},

Understanding blast wave development and accurately quantifying its effect on structural systems remains a considerable challenge to the scientific community. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental study into the loading acting on, and subsequent deformation of, targets subjected to nearfield explosive detonations. Two experimental test series were conducted at the University of Sheffield (UoS), UK, and the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa, where blast load distributions using Hopkinson pressure bars and dynamic target deflections using digital image correlation were measured respectively. It is shown through conservation of momentum and Hopkinson-Cranz scaling that initial plate velocity profiles are directly proportional to the imparted impulse distribution, and that spatial variations in loading as a result of surface instabilities in the expanding detonation product cloud are significant enough to influence the transient displacement profile of a blast loaded plate.},

It requires high spatial resolutions and thus very large computational efforts to keep this discretization error sufficiently small up to the far field of an explosion.

The principal purpose is to allow an accurate and fully bounded, hence stable, approximation of turbulence convection in the context of two-equation eddy viscosity and Reynolds stress transport modelling of two- and three-dimensional flows, both subsonic and transonic. Among other benefits, this capability permits an assessment to be made of the adequacy of approximating turbulence convection with first-order upwind schemes in conjunction with higher-order formulations for mean-flow properties-a widespread practice. The performance characteristics of the bounded scheme are illustrated by reference to computations for scalar transport, for a transonic flow in a Lava1 nozzle, for one separated laminar flow and for two separated turbulent flows computed with a non-linear RNG model and full Reynolds stress closure.},

In most of cases, structural damage and the glass hazard have been major contributors to death and injury for the targeted buildings.

A review of current methods of modeling blast wave propagation identiﬁes a need for a modeling system that is both fast and versatile in its scope of application. This is followed by a description of a preliminary study that used artiﬁcial neural networks to estimate peak pressures on buildings protected by simple blast barriers, using data generated from, ﬁrst, an existing empirical model and, second, miniature bomb-barrier-building experiments. The ﬁrst of these studies demonstrates the viability of the approach in terms of producing accurate results very rapidly. However, the study using data from live miniature bomb-barrier-building experiments was inconclusive due to a poor distribution of the sample data. The paper then describes ongoing research reﬁning this artiﬁcial neural network approach to allow the modeling of the time-wise progress of the blast wave over the surfaces of critical structures, facilitating a three-dimensional visualization of the problem. Finally, the paper outlines a proposed novel method of modeling blast wave propagation that uses a coarse-grain simulation approach combined with artiﬁcial neural networks, which has the goal of extending modeling to complicated geometries while maintaining rapid processing.},

Strategies must be set to identify design features and materials that can enhance the vessels protection in the event of shock loadings e.g. air blast and underwater explosions. However, assessing design solutions is not a trivial task because of the large number of unknowns involved. Appropriate computational models and experimental tests can give insights into the expected mechanical behaviour to support the design process. The authors are developing a framework for vulnerability assessment, which includes experimental tests and appropriate finite element (FE) models of representative structural parts subjected to blast loading. This combined approach provides a comprehensive analysis tool but its complexity prevents the quick assessment of the vessel structural vulnerability when various design features and a range of materials are to be considered. To overcome this hurdle, a machine learning model based on Artificial Neural Networks is proposed here for identifying patterns in numerical and experimental data, yielding clear and swift conclusions about the structural response.},

Our proposed method reduces to a standard trust region approach for the unconstrained problem when there are no upper or lower bounds on the variables. Global and local quadratic convergence is established. Preliminary numerical experiments are reported indicating the practical viability of this approach.},

Despite recent technological advancements that have allowed for more reliable and affordable sensors and equipment for gathering data from experimental tests and for massive parallel computations, the long lead times needed for setting up experiments or for processing high strain rate simulations may restrict, or even prohibit, their applicability. A new framework based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that can detect patterns in experimental and numerical data is proposed for giving timely conclusions about the overall structural response of mild steel plates subjected to localised blast. A supervised training regimen using experimental test results from the literature was designed to ascertain the capability of the ANN to predict physical response to blast events. Responses such as charge impulse, and plate bulging and tearing are computed based on readily available inputs such as charge dimensions and plate properties.},

  title = {Machine Learning Methods for Predicting the Outcome of Hypervelocity Impact Events},
  volume = {45},
  abstract = {The outcome of projectile impacts on spaced aluminium armour (i.e. Whipple shield) at hypervelocity is traditionally predicted by semi-analytical equations known as ballistic limit equations (BLEs). For spherical aluminium projectiles impacting aluminium Whipple shields, the state-of-the-art BLE has been found to correctly reproduce the perforation/non-perforation result of approximately 75\% of tests contained within a database with over 1100 entries. For such high-dimensional, complex problems, machine learning methods may be a superior approach over such semi-analytical/empirical methods. Towards this end an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) have been developed to better classify the outcome of hypervelocity impact events on aluminium Whipple shields. The ANN was found to correctly reproduce the perforation/non-perforation result of over 93\% of the training exemplars, generalizing at 92.2\% when applied with an optimized architecture. The SVM was not able to reach comparable levels of generalization error as the ANN, peaking at 83\% after the removal of a small number of test exemplars which induced conﬂict within the SVM pattern recognition. Although providing a signiﬁcant improvement in predictive accuracy over the conventional BLE, the performance of both the ANN and SVM were highly sensitive to the population density of the parameter space described by the training data. Within highly populated regions the qualitative trends of the machines are demonstrated to accurately identify patterns associated with projectile fragmentation and melting, while in sparsely populated regions the accuracy signiﬁcantly decreases and the qualitative trends can become nonsensical. Further improvements in accuracy are limited by the inhomogeneous sampling of the parameter space deﬁned by the current impact test database—a problem expected to be typical of any terminal ballistics problem in which the cost of performing experiments limits their scope to, for example, materials and geometries of interest, impact conditions expected during operation, and a limited range about the perforation threshold (i.e. ballistic limit). A combined novelty-detecting neural net and heteroassociate neural net have been applied to iteratively improve the performance of the ANN without requiring an inordinate number of additional tests. This process, referred to as bootstrapping, has been successfully demonstrated through the design of ‘optimized’ Whipple shields for given impact conditions, hypervelocity impact testing of the designed shields, and re-training of the critic net to incorporate the results of the new impact tests.},

The traditional armor design studies performed with FEM requires sophisticated procedures and intensive computational effort, therefore simpler and accurate numerical approaches are always worthwhile to decrease armor development time. This study aims to apply a hybrid method using FEM simulation and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) analysis to approximate ballistic limit thickness for armor steels. To achieve this objective, a predictive model based on the artiﬁcial neural networks is developed to determine ballistic resistance of high hardness armor steels against 7.62 mm armor piercing ammunition. In this methodology, the FEM simulations are used to create training cases for Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) three layer networks. In order to validate FE simulation methodology, ballistic shot tests on 20 mm thickness target were performed according to standard Stanag 4569. Afterwards, the successfully trained ANN(s) is used to predict the ballistic limit thickness of 500 HB high hardness steel armor. Results show that even with limited number of data, FEM-ANN approach can be used to predict ballistic penetration depth with adequate accuracy.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {This paper reports on the development of a new approach for simulating the thermal behavior of buildings that overcome the limitations of conventional heat-transfer simulation methods such as the ﬁnite difference method and the ﬁnite element method. The proposed technique uses a coarse-grain approach to model development whereby each element represents a complete building component such as a wall, internal space, or ﬂoor. The thermal behavior of each coarse-grain element is captured using empirical modeling techniques such as artiﬁcial neural networks ͑ANNs͒. The main advantages of the approach compared to conventional simulation methods are ͑1͒ simpliﬁed model construction for the end-user; ͑2͒ simpliﬁed model reconﬁguration; ͑3͒ signiﬁcantly faster simulation runs ͑orders of magnitude faster for two- and three-dimensional models͒; and ͑4͒ potentially more accurate results. The paper demonstrates the viability of the approach through a number of experiments with a model of a composite wall. The approach is shown to be able to sustain highly accurate long-term simulation runs, if the coarse-grain modeling elements are implemented as ANNs. In contrast, an implementation of the coarse-grain elements using a linear model is shown to function inaccurately and erratically. The paper concludes with an identiﬁcation of on-going work and future areas for development of the technique.},

  volume = {3},
  abstract = {The paper discusses the first stage in a study concerned with the development and evaluation of a fast, accurate, and versatile method of simulating blast wave propagation within complex built environments (comprising any configuration of structures such as buildings and blast barriers). Existing methods of modeling the propagation of a blast wave each fail in at least one of the speed, accuracy or versatility requirements. Conventional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, for example, typically take several days to complete a single run. An alternative, novel method proposed here is to use a simulation approach implemented within a coarse spatial and time framework, where the mesh elements and time steps are orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional CFD simulations. The approach requires the use of intelligent modeling techniques to capture the behavior of elements at the coarse level. Specifically hybrids of artificial neural networks and multivariate linear predictors are used to capture the characteristic behavior of a blast wave at different locations within a built environment. These can then be assembled to represent the configuration of the actual environment under investigation. The hybrid modules are trained using data generated specifically for the task from CFD simulation runs. The novelty of the approach is in the use of these hybrid modules to learn appropriate driving equations that operate at a coarse level in space and time, and to execute the simulation within a discrete-event (as opposed to continuous) simulation environment. As a proof of concept, this study focuses on one-dimensional simulation modeling. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in terms of its ability to replicate the predictions of CFD simulations very closely and to complete a simulation run orders of magnitude faster than a CFD simulation (within a few seconds as opposed to hours or days).},

An analysis of the current situation indicates that progress in the development of artiﬁcial neural network applications has largely stagnated. Suggestions are made for advancing the ﬁeld to the next level of sophistication and application, using genetic algorithms and related techniques. It is shown that this approach will require the design of some very sophisticated genetic coding mechanisms in order to develop the required higher-order network structures, and will utilize development mechanisms observed in nature such as growth, self-organization, and multi-stage objective functions. The capabilities of such an approach and the way in which they can be achieved are explored with reference to the problems of: (a) determining truck attributes from the strain envelopes they induce in structural members when crossing a bridge, and; (b) developing a decision support system for dynamic control of industrialized manufacturing of houses.},
