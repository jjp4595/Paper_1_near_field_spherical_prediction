Both the total impulses and blast pressure histories were captured, the latter using a centrally mounted Hopkinson bar. Repeatable and consistent total impulse values were achieved, while the Hopkinson bar technique was sufficient to capture the essential shape of the blast loads, although the fine detail of the peak pressure could not be resolved due to higher mode dispersion. A short stand-off configuration produced short duration blast loads that approached an ideal impulsive load condition with near uniform impulse distributions, although the blast pressure distributions were non-uniform. Conversely, a blast tube configuration produced blast loads with near uniform pressure and impulse distributions but did not approach an ideal impulsive load condition, that is, the pressure history must be accounted for in subsequent analytical work.},

  abstract = {Explosive tests were performed in air to study the dynamic mechanical response of square honeycomb core sandwich panels made from a super-austenitic stainless steel alloy. Tests were conducted at three levels of impulse load on the sandwich panels and solid plates with the same areal density. Impulse was varied by changing the charge weight of the explosive at a constant standoff distance. At the lowest intensity load, significant front face bending and progressive cell wall buckling were observed at the center of the panel closest to the explosion source. Cell wall buckling and core densification increased as the impulse increased. An air blast simulation code was used to determine the blast loads at the front surfaces of the test panels, and these were used as inputs to finite element calculations of the dynamic response of the sandwich structure. Very good agreement was observed between the finite element model predictions of the sandwich panel front and back face displacements and the experimental observations. The model also captured many of the phenomenological details of the core deformation behavior. The honeycomb sandwich panels suffered significantly smaller back face deflections than solid plates of identical mass even though their design was far from optimal for such an application.},

Available models commonly consider trinitrotoluene explosive as the standard charge. In this article, the trinitrotoluene equivalency factor is studied through verified one-dimensional numerical simulations. The equivalency factors for impulse and overpressure are different and found to be constant with the scaled distance (3–40 m/kg1/3), which means that a unique value for the equivalency factor is suitable for the equivalency factor calculation for each distance. Comparison of the equivalency factor with available models shows that it strongly depends on the internal energy ratio of the explosive in interest, relative to trinitrotoluene, and a new formula for equivalency factor for overpressure is proposed. A verified simulation method is presented in which the explosive is modeled with an equivalent “air bubble” with the same internal energy and ideal gas equation of state. A new approach using the energy flux density calculation is presented to calculate the equivalency factor for impulse and overpressure from a single gauge measurement of overpressure-time history, at a specific distance.},

  abstract = {A growing interest for the design of structures to sustain blast-induced loads has been observed in recent years as a result of the worldwide rise of terrorist bombing attacks. The blast loading is usually characterized by a sudden increase in the pressure followed by an exponential decay. The parameters of this pressure pulse are essential for design and can be found in various blast design manuals available in the open literature. One of the most widely used sources is a technical report by Kingery–Bulmash, which provides values for many blast parameters in diagrams and polynomial form. However, it does not include an equation for calculating the blast wave decay coefficient, necessary for constructing the pressure–time history of an explosion at a certain point. In this study, a review of the technical literature that contains expressions for the blast pressure decay coefficient is performed, and relevant comparisons have been made. New equations describing the decay coefficient of the Friedlander equation for both incident and reflected cases for free-air and surface bursts are proposed. These equations express the decay coefficient in terms of the scaled distance and are not valid for close-in detonations. They are entirely based on the Kingery–Bulmash data, and their accuracy is satisfactorily checked against new experimental results and their trends assessed through a sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, the positive phase of the pressure–time curve at a point can be reliably and efficiently generated.},

Explosive wall breaching is a key capability in military operations in urban terrain environments where the close proximity of urban structures significantly restricts the use of large demolition charges. Explosive breaching is also used by special operations groups as a means to gain entry into a structure where conventional breaching methods are not sufficient or the emergency situation requires immediate entry to save lives. This paper develops an analytical model for the explosive breaching of protective targets such as concrete and masonry walls. It provides simple analytical models based on the principles of blast physics and the conservation laws for the characteristics of contact charges required to produce a wall breach of the required shape and size. The model is validated using the experimental data. An illustrative example is included to demonstrate the model’s ability to predict the size of a breach hole in a thick masonry wall.},

This paper presents the results from a series of well controlled experiments where pressure transducers are used to record the pressure-time history acting on the face of a large, rigid target at various angles of incidence for varying sizes of hemispherical PE4 charge and stand-off distances. The test data demonstrated remarkable repeatability, and excellent agreement with semi-empirical predictions for normally reflected overpressures. The oblique results show that peak overpressure, impulse and duration are highly dependent on angle of incidence for the positive phase, and are invariant of angle of incidence for the negative phase.},

Two experimental test series were conducted at the University of Sheffield (UoS), UK, and the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa, where blast load distributions using Hopkinson pressure bars and dynamic target deflections using digital image correlation were measured respectively. It is shown through conservation of momentum and Hopkinson-Cranz scaling that initial plate velocity profiles are directly proportional to the imparted impulse distribution, and that spatial variations in loading as a result of surface instabilities in the expanding detonation product cloud are significant enough to influence the transient displacement profile of a blast loaded plate.},

  abstract = {Near-field blast loads are high in magnitude, short in duration, and non-uniformly distributed across the loaded face of a structural element. Experimental characterisation of near-field blast loading and the resulting deformation of a blast loaded target is made difficult by conflicting requirements, namely: robustness to survive the extreme loading conditions; and sensitivity to accurately measure transient behaviour at high sampling frequencies. As such, there is little definitive experimental data in the literature, and the deformation behaviour of plates subjected to non-uniform impulsive loading is yet to be properly quantified. This paper presents an update on the ongoing collaborative research effort between the University of Sheffield, UK, and the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Direct experimental measurements of blast pressure and impulse using an array of Hopkinson pressure bars (Sheffield), and high-fidelity transient plate deformation measurements using digital image correlation (Cape Town) are jointly-used to assess, and develop predictive methods for, the response of blast loaded plates. Simplified predictive methods, based on knowledge of the applied load rather than an assumed distribution, have been developed which show very good correlation with the experiments and physics-based numerical models.},

There exists very little direct measurement of blast parameters in the nearfield, mainly attributed to the lack of instrumentation sufficiently robust to survive extreme loading events yet sensitive enough to capture salient features of the blast. Instead literature guidance is informed largely by early numerical analyses and parametric studies.

  abstract = {Recent experimental work by the current authors has provided highly spatially and temporally resolved measurements of the loading imparted to, and the subsequent dynamic response of, structures subjected to near-field explosive loading [1]. In this article we validate finite element models of plates subjected to near-field blast loads and perform a parametric study into the relationship between imparted load and peak and residual plate deformation. The energy equivalent impulse is derived, based on the theory of upper bound kinetic energy uptake introduced herein, which accounts for the additional energy imparted to a structure from a spatially non-uniform blast load. Whilst plate deflection is weakly correlated to total impulse, there is shown to be a strong positive correlation between deflection and energy equivalent impulse. The strength of this correlation is insensitive to loading distribution and mode of response. The method developed in this article has clear applications for the generation of fast-running engineering tools for the prediction of structural response to near-field explosions.},

  abstract = {Accurate quantification of the loading on a structure resulting from the impingement of a blast wave following a high explosive detonation is crucial if analysts are to be able to determine the viability of protective structures. This is of particular importance in the case of near-field explosive detonations, where the magnitude of the loading is extremely high, and highly spatially non-uniform over the face of the target. This loading can result in localised failure of structural targets due to brisance or rear-face spalling (predominantly load magnitude related phenomena) or shear failure due to spatially non-uniform impulse take-up of the target (predominantly impulse related phenomenon). However, no clear and simple guidance exists on how to define the magnitude and spatial variation of very near-field blast loading. Whilst it is possible to use numerical modelling approaches to simulate the detonation, air-shock propagation and shock-structure interaction, little definitive, well controlled experimental data exists to validate such models.},

  abstract = {A considerable amount of scientific effort has been expended over many decades on developing means of predicting the loading generated when a blast wave impinges on a structure. Semi-empirical ‘look-up’ predictive methods, such as those incorporated in the UFC-3-340-02 manual, the ConWep code or the *LOAD\_BLAST module of LS-DYNA, offer a simple means for predicting the blast loading generated in geometrically simple scenarios. However, reported test data frequently show considerable spread and lack of repeatability, which is often attributed to some inherent variability in the blast waves developed from detonations, although no definitive physical interpretation has been forwarded as to the source of such inherent variation. As such, the semi-empirical predictions are often viewed as only ‘ball-park’ or ‘order of magnitude’ estimations.},

  abstract = {Many conventional high explosives do not contain sufficient internal oxygen to fully combust the gaseous products which result from detonation of the explosive material. Because of this, under-oxygenated explosives continue to burn after detonation. This process, called afterburn, is known to influence the late-time pressure and energy released by the explosive, which has particular significance for confined explosives. Recent experimental work at the University of Sheffield, along with a small number of previous studies, has shown that some afterburn occurs at timescales commensurate with the development of the shock wave. This article presents the results from a series of tests measuring the reflected pressure acting on a rigid target following the detonation of small explosive charges. High-speed video is used to capture the emerging structure of the detonation products and air shock, while the spatial and temporal distributions of the reflected pressure are recorded using an array of 17 Hopkinson pressure bars set flush with an effectively rigid target. Tests are conducted in inert atmospheres and oxygen-rich atmospheres in order to assess the contribution of rapid afterburn on the development of the shock front and interaction with a rigid target situated close to the explosive charge. The results show that early-stage afterburn has a significant influence on the reflected shock parameters in the near-field.},
