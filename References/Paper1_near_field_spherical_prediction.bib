  abstract = {The response of I-shaped, or wide-flange, sections subjected to close-in detonations has been evaluated through numerical simulations. A simulation approach for close-in detonation, which includes two stages, is suggested. The first stage includes the modelling of the detonation process through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the second stage includes only the free vibrations of the structural member. The suggested approach is validated by a comparison with two experimental results for close-in detonations. Then, a parametric study for Isections with their weak axis subjected to close-in detonations has been performed. Various spherical charges and standoff distances have been studied, with scaled distances in the range of 0.15–0.29 m/kg1/3. Bare members and members strengthened with stiffeners have been simulated. The influence of charge and standoff distance, and the addition of stiffeners on several parameters affecting deformation and folding angles, has been studied. The effect of localized pressure confined between the flanges and the stiffeners at the midspan, which can lead to increased total and local deformations, is illustrated. Finally, an alternative strengthening method, in which the flanges are connected with bars, is presented as an optional stiffening technique.}

The suitability of the proposed model is examined by using the finite element simulation of a blast test with steel plates and comparing the predicted deflections with the measurements. The results reveal that the proposed model accurately calculates the blast load distribution over the structure surface. The predicted deflection profiles of the steel plates are closer to the measured deflection profiles when the proposed model is employed, as compared to the existing models, which produce only a single impulse curve.},

Such factors as the accessibility of information on the construction of bomb devices, relative ease of manufacturing, mobility and portability, coupled with significant property damage and injuries, are responsible for significant increase in bomb attacks all over the world. In most of cases, structural damage and the glass hazard have been major contributors to death and injury for the targeted buildings. Following the events of September 11, 2001, the so-called “icon buildings” are perceived to be attractive targets for possible terrorist attacks. Research into methods for protecting buildings against such bomb attacks is required. Several analysis methods available to predict the loads from a high explosive blast on buildings are examined. Analytical and numerical techniques are presented and the results obtained by different methods are compared. A number of examples are given.},

Understanding blast wave development and accurately quantifying its effect on structural systems remains a considerable challenge to the scientific community. This paper presents a comprehensive experimental study into the loading acting on, and subsequent deformation of, targets subjected to nearfield explosive detonations. Two experimental test series were conducted at the University of Sheffield (UoS), UK, and the University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa, where blast load distributions using Hopkinson pressure bars and dynamic target deflections using digital image correlation were measured respectively. It is shown through conservation of momentum and Hopkinson-Cranz scaling that initial plate velocity profiles are directly proportional to the imparted impulse distribution, and that spatial variations in loading as a result of surface instabilities in the expanding detonation product cloud are significant enough to influence the transient displacement profile of a blast loaded plate.},

  abstract = {Near-field blast loads are high in magnitude, short in duration, and non-uniformly distributed across the loaded face of a structural element. Experimental characterisation of near-field blast loading and the resulting deformation of a blast loaded target is made difficult by conflicting requirements, namely: robustness to survive the extreme loading conditions; and sensitivity to accurately measure transient behaviour at high sampling frequencies. As such, there is little definitive experimental data in the literature, and the deformation behaviour of plates subjected to non-uniform impulsive loading is yet to be properly quantified. This paper presents an update on the ongoing collaborative research effort between the University of Sheffield, UK, and the University of Cape Town, South Africa. Direct experimental measurements of blast pressure and impulse using an array of Hopkinson pressure bars (Sheffield), and high-fidelity transient plate deformation measurements using digital image correlation (Cape Town) are jointly-used to assess, and develop predictive methods for, the response of blast loaded plates. Simplified predictive methods, based on knowledge of the applied load rather than an assumed distribution, have been developed which show very good correlation with the experiments and physics-based numerical models.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental work by the current authors has provided highly spatially and temporally resolved measurements of the loading imparted to, and the subsequent dynamic response of, structures subjected to near-field explosive loading [1]. In this article we validate finite element models of plates subjected to near-field blast loads and perform a parametric study into the relationship between imparted load and peak and residual plate deformation. The energy equivalent impulse is derived, based on the theory of upper bound kinetic energy uptake introduced herein, which accounts for the additional energy imparted to a structure from a spatially non-uniform blast load. Whilst plate deflection is weakly correlated to total impulse, there is shown to be a strong positive correlation between deflection and energy equivalent impulse. The strength of this correlation is insensitive to loading distribution and mode of response. The method developed in this article has clear applications for the generation of fast-running engineering tools for the prediction of structural response to near-field explosions.}

A three-dimensional finite element model is established with validated material parameters, blast load model and reasonable choice of boundary conditions. Three small-scale RCSs are designed and cast, two RCS are subject to the explosion at a scaled distance of 0.611 m/kg1/3 and another RCS is subjected to blast load at a scaled distance of 0.77 m/kg1/3 to calibrate and validate the finite element model. The experimental results of damage area and linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) are analyzed and compared with finite element analysis prediction. The comparison indicates that the failure patterns of these slabs are categorized as three types, including the low damage, moderate damage and severe damage in both experimental tests and numerical simulations. In addition, the numerical results of RCSs are consistent with test results, except for the formation of cracks, which demonstrates that the blast-resistant capacities of RCSs can improve with the reinforcement ratio increasing and the explosive charges decreasing.}
