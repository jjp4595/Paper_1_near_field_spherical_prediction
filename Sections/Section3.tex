\section{Air blast loading using \textit{Apollo Blastsimulator}}
\subsection{Mesh Sensitivity}
Include theta vs I graph with multiple cell resolutions and experimental values. 
Can discuss that convergence takes longer around areas of mach stem formation etc. 
Using the R/cell length graph. Apollo may appear to converge sooner due to the staging algorithm it uses. IE the R/cell length is actually a lot smaller because of the smaller stage length but consistent resolution.
