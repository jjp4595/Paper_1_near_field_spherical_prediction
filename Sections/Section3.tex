\subsection{Mesh sensitivity}
A mesh sensitivity study was undertaken to inform the choice of mesh to be used to generate the datasets herein. 
The lower bound of the dataset was chosen as this represents the highest required resolution.
Table \ref{tab:mesh_sens} presents the meshes that were studied.

A feature of \textit{Apollo blastsimulator} is its dynamic mesh adaptation (DMA) capabilities (Figure \ref{fig:DMA}).
This allows the efficient use of computational resources by directing them to areas within the mesh with the largest local gradients (e.g. the shock front).
DMA was used to generate the data within this research, and its effects are studied compared with the uniform mesh resolution scenario.

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:mesh_convergence_z0_055_1} presents the mesh convergence data as a function of number of cells between the centre of the charge and the target face. 
Convergence was deemed to be adequate within $10\%$ of the ``convereged'' value at $R/\text{cell length} = 15$. 
Convergence is shown to be quicker when considering the total impulse on a $1m^2$ plate.

Further mesh studies were performed to assess the impact of the DMA module, and different $R/\text{cell length}$ values on the distribution of peak specific impulse. 
Figure \ref{fig:mesh_convergence_dataset2} presents this information, with the plot labels representing the meshes in Table \ref{tab:mesh_sens2}. 
It shows that overall, the distribution itself convergences at a fairly coarse level (ultimate cell size of $6.250$mm), whilst it is only the peak values that do not converge for the coarser meshes, shown in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_convergence_dataset3}.
Meshes E and F study the effect of the DMA module on the overall distribution. 
It is shown that the DMA does introduce artificial oscillations to the impulse distribution, however, in context with the shape of the overall profile these are deemed to be acceptable. 
Mesh D was chosen, with an ultimate cell size of $3.15mm$.

\subsection{Experimental validation}
The CFD data was then compared to experimental data from the University of Sheffield. 
100g of PE4 was detonated at a perpendicular standoff distance of 80mm (to the centre of the charge), HPBs places at intervals meant there is pressure and impulse-time history data for the follwing angles of incidence: $0, 17, 32, 43 \text{ and } 51$ degrees.
The comparison for pressure and impulse time-histories are given in Figure \ref{fig:80mm_validation_OP_imp}.
Pressure-time histories show good agreement for peak values and arrival times, whilst the impulse time-histories show fairly good agreement for all given angles of incidence. 

An experimental comparison for peak impulse distribution is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_convergence_z0_055_3} where \textit{Apollo} appears to agree with the upper bound of the experimental dataset.

\end{figure}

Considering the dataset as a whole, the peak specific impulse distributions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_convergence_dataset1}, and smoothed versions in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_convergence_dataset1a}. 
The smoothing was completed with a Savitzky-Golay filter \cite{savitzkySmoothingDifferentiationData1964} and is shown to maintain the overall distribution whilst removing the artificial oscillations from the DMA module. 
Normalising each sample to the maximum at theta $= 0$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mesh_convergence_dataset1b} where it is shown that the normalised specific impulse profiles across the chosen range of scaled distances can be considered homogeneous.
