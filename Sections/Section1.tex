Consider the reflection of a blast wave after it strikes a rigid target, Figure \ref{fig:RPB}. The angle of incidence $\theta$, at a point on the surface is defined as the angle between the outward normal of the surface and the direct vector from the explosive charge to that point. \cite{rigbyAngleIncidenceEffects2015}.
