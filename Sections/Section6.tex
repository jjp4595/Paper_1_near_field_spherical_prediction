\section{Summary and Conclusions}
This paper presents a methodology for producing a FREM (fast running engineering model) that can predict specific impulse distributions for a given scaled distance. 
The data has been generated by a CFD software, \textit{Apollo blastsimulator} which has been validated by experimental results performed at the University of Sheffield.

Two models have been proposed within this paper, built from a CFD dataset of 100g PE4 charges (with a TNT equivalence factor of 1.2 applied).
The first model can be considered a more accurate FREM for a smaller window of scaled distance, where $i$ represents peak specific impulse:
