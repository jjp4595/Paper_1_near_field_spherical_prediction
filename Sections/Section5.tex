\section{Discussion}
Compare the proposed model with previous models:
Jang, Dharmasena, RPB to show that this model is the best!
Also compare with Shin et al and their adjusted UFC values
Also compare with original UFC values. 
Henrych model?

\subsection{Area integrated impulse comparison}
Integrate over an area to get the area-integrated impulse from CFD analyses. 
Perform the same thing with my model (and Jang, RPB etc) and see percentage difference. This will give physical meaning to the values. 
Plot surface: of impulse percentage difference (z) vs scaled radius (x) and scaled distance (y). 
This gives an insight into how accurate the models are
