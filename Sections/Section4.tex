\subsection{Randers-Pehrson Bannister (RPB) Model}
The specific impulse acting on a target is dependent on the angle of incidence of the shock front, theta, with respect to the normal of the target surface. 
From \textcite{randers-pehrsonAirblastLoadingModel1997},
\begin{equation}
	i = i_r cos^2\theta + i_{so}(1 + cos^2\theta - 2cos\theta). 
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:RPB} shows the angle of incidence and slant distance for a point on a target subjected to a spherical air burst, a distance $R$ away from the target centre.
From trigonometry, we have that $\bar{R}^2 = R^2 + x^2 + y^2$, where $x \text{ and } y$ are horizontal and vertical distance from the centre of the target, and $cos \theta = R / \bar{R}$.

\subsection{Model performance test}
Test the model with unseen data to demonstrate how this would work.
